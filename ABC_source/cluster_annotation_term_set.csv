CCN202210140_SUBC,subcluster,"The finest level of cell type definition in the human whole brain taxonomy. It is defined by applying Louvain clustering independently for each cluster. Cells within a subcluster share similar characteristics and belong to the same cluster. In some cases subclusters are distinct, and in other cases represent cell states or gradients within the same cluster.",2
CCN202210140_CLUS,cluster,An intermediate level of cell type definitions in the human whole brain taxonomy. It is defined by applying Louvain clustering independently for each supercluster. All cells within a subcluster belong to the same cluster.   Clusters group together similar subclusters and are highly distinct from one another.,1
CCN202210140_SUPC,supercluster,The top level of cell type definition in the human whole brain taxonomy. It is defined using Louvain clustering (Cytograph) with most superclusters determined by broad brain region and neurotransmitter type.  All cells within a cluster belong to the same supercluster. Supercluster provides a broader characterization of cell types.,0
CCN202210140_NEUR,neurotransmitter,Neurotransmitter terms are assigned to clusters based on the expression (or lack of expression) of one or more neurotransmitter-associated transporter or enzyme genes,3
